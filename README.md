# 2.  Users Experience (UX)
- As a user I want to be able to navigate through the whole site smoothly. 
- As a user I want to easily be able to contact.
- As a user I want to know price.
- As a user I want to know if i can cancel the order.
- As a user i want to know what i get in the vegetables basket.

 ## Structure
 Three different pages with home, product and sign up.
 The structure should be easy to understand and navigate. 
 There are a navbar, hero image on the top of the header for each page and a footer with social media.

 # 3. Design Choices

- ## Typography
I chose one that was most readable in my opinion. 
Toboto-serif for the headlines
Open-sansa for body text structure and sans-serif as a alternativ just in case thoose others fails.

- ## Color Scheme
The color I use to this project.

# 7. Troubleshooting

- Have alot problem with media Media queries and i only have the time to fix the logo, menu and hero image before I need to submit

I have alot of problem with the position for everything and i try to google it and find https://www.w3schools.com/ very helpfull. But it was first when Tutor Assistance help me with the form that I really understod it. 



# 8. Debugging
