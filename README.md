 ## Structure
 Three different pages with home, product and sign up.
 The structure should be easy to understand and navigate. 
 There are a navbar, hero image on the top of the header for each page and a footer with social media.

 # Design Choices

- ## Typography
I chose one that was most readable in my opinion. 
Toboto-serif for the headlines
Open-sansa for body text structure and sans-serif as a alternativ just in case thoose others fails.
